## Safecracker

Traditional safes use a three-wheel locking mechanism, with the safe combination entered using a dial on the door of the safe. The dial is marked with clockwise increments between 0 and 99. The three-number combination is entered by first dialling to the right (clockwise), then to the left (anti-clockwise), and then to the right (clockwise) again. Combination numbers are read from the top of the dial:

Given the starting (top) position of the dial and the increments used for each turn of the dial, return an array containing the combination of the safe.
#### Step-By-Step Example

    safecracker(0, [3, 10, 5]) âžž [97, 7, 2]

    Starting dial position of 0 (same as the diagram above).

    First turn (rightward) of 3 increments:
    0 -> 99, 98, 97
    First number of combination = 97

    Second turn (leftward) of 10 increments:
    97 -> 98, 99, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
    Second number of combination = 7

    Third turn (rightward) of 5 increments:
    7 -> 6, 5, 4, 3, 2
    Third number of combination = 2

    The final combination is [97, 7, 2]

## zipWith

Create a zipWith function that takes two arrays of numbers and a function that will apply to each pair of numbers in the two arrays. The zipWith function should return a new array from the results.

 #### Examples

    zipWith( Math.pow, [10,10,10,10], [0,1,2,3] )
    //[1,10,100,1000]

    zipWith( Math.max, [1,4,7,1,4,7], [4,7,1,4,7,1] )
    // [4,7,7,4,7,7]

    zipWith( function(a,b) { return a+b; }, [0,1,2,3], [0,1,2,3] ) 
    //[0,2,4,6]

    zipWith( (a,b) => a+b, [0,1,2,3], [0,1,2,3] )
    //[0,2,4,6]

## sumOfAllArrays

Create a function that will sum all the values in an array and its subarrays 

 #### Examples

    arraySum([1, 2])
    //3
    
    arraySum([1, 2, 3])
    //6
    
    arraySum([1, 2, [1, 2, [3]]])
    //9
